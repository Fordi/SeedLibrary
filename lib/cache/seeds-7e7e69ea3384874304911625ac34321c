by the Robert Buist Company. Heavy yields of
football-shaped 4-8 pound muskmelons. Hardshelled
with firm sweet flesh. Great old-fashioned
flavor associated with roadside stand melons. If you
can only grow one melon and do not want to be
disappointed, this is the variety to grow. 90-100 days.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:10:"directSeed";s:7:"1" Deep";s:11:"seedsToHill";s:9:"6-8 Seeds";s:4:"thin";s:13:"To 3-4 Plants";s:5:"light";s:8:"Full Sun";}}

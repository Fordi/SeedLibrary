cucumber matures into what looks like a large
russet potato. Smooth-skinned fruits turn from
white to golden-yellow to russet brown and may be
eaten at any stage, skin and all. Tender, crisp, and
delicious. Hardy disease resistant vines produce an
early crop with good yields. 55 days.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:10:"directSeed";s:7:"1" Deep";s:11:"seedsToHill";s:9:"6-8 Seeds";s:4:"thin";s:13:"To 3-4 Plants";s:5:"light";s:8:"Full Sun";}}

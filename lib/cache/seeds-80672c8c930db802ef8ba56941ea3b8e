grown on the sandy hills north of town. Farmers would
fill their horse-drawn “triple box” wagons in the field,
haul them to town, and sell the melons right from the
wagons. Today SSE member Marvin Kucera is the only
person growing this watermelon in Chelsea. Sweet,
pink-fleshed, 15-20 pound fruits with white seeds will
keep for several weeks once picked. 90-100 days.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":0:{}}

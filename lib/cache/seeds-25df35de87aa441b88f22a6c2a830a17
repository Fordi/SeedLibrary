by Vilmorin in the 1800s. Pods are narrow and
twisted like a caterpillar rolled up on itself. Lowgrowing
plants with tiny yellow flowers make a
beautiful ground cover. Caterpillars may be added
to salads to surprise unexpected diners, but are
generally not meant to be eaten because they are so
spiky. Can be grown in containers if space is tight.
Great historic novelty. Annual.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:12:"startIndoors";s:27:"3-4 weeks before last frost";s:11:"germination";s:10:"10-14 days";s:13:"plantOutdoors";s:11:"6-10" Apart";s:5:"light";s:8:"Full Sun";}}

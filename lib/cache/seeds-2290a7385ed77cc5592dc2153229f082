mentioned even earlier in 1629 by John Parkinson,
who described this single hollyhock as being “of
a darke red like blackblood.” Appears black on
overcast days, but will have a hint of red in bright
sun. Plant next to a white fence for a spectacular
contrast. Self-seeding biennial, 5-6' tall.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:10:"directSeed";s:9:"1/8" Deep";s:11:"germination";s:10:"10-14 Days";s:4:"thin";s:12:"18-36" Apart";s:5:"light";s:17:"Sun/Partial Shade";}}

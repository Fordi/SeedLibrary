Floral Park, New York, in his 1921 catalog. Ben
Quisenberry renamed it Gold Medal and listed it
in his 1976 catalog: “The sweetest tomato you ever
tasted. The yellow with streaks of red makes them
very attractive and a gourmet’s joy when sliced.” Our
finest bi-colored tomato—orange-yellow splashed
with tomato pink. Winner of the 2008 SSE Tomato
Tasting. Indeterminate, 75-90 days from transplant.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:12:"startIndoors";s:25:"6 weeks before last frost";s:11:"germination";s:9:"7-14 Days";s:13:"plantOutdoors";s:12:"24-36" Apart";s:7:"support";s:22:"Cage, stake or trellis";}}

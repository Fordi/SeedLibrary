Carl Swidorski, who said the seed originated
in Poland circa 1900. Part of SSEâ€™s 1997 Polish
Collection. Phenomenal set of 3" by 6" red paste
tomatoes on vigorous wispy vines. Excellent flavor
and very few seeds make this a perfect processing
tomato. Fruits hold well on the vine. Indeterminate,
85 days from transplant.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:12:"startIndoors";s:25:"6 weeks before last frost";s:11:"germination";s:9:"7-14 Days";s:13:"plantOutdoors";s:12:"24-36" Apart";s:7:"support";s:22:"Cage, stake or trellis";}}

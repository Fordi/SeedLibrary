Heritage Farm. Eye-catching plants heavily laden
with pendulous dark pink catkins. Makes handsome
dried bouquets, but nice as a fresh cut flower too.
Exotic and beautiful when the plants are swaying in
the summer breeze. Difficult to transplant; sow in
place. Self-seeding annual, 6-9' tall.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":0:{}}

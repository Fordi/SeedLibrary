discovered growing in Caracas, Venezuela. Beautiful
spiral-shaped pale purple flowers with cream and
yellow markings, very fragrant. Vines in tropical
regions can reach 20'. Can be successfully grown in
pots with adequate support. Very easy to overwinter
indoors with numerous blooms the second season.
Extremely hard to produce viable seed; this difficulty
is reflected in the higher price. Tender vine grown as a
perennial in the South and an annual in the North.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:12:"startIndoors";s:27:"4-6 weeks before last frost";s:11:"germination";s:9:"5-15 Days";s:13:"plantOutdoors";s:10:"6-8" Apart";s:5:"light";s:8:"Full Sun";}}

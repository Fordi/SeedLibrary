documented beans. Named Lazy Housewife because
it was the first snap bean that did not need to
have the string removed. Vines bear heavily and
continuously until frost. Straight 5-6" long pods
with distinctive shiny white seeds. Pole habit, snap
or shell, 75-80 days.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":0:{}}

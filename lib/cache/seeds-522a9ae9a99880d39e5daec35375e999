Ornamental pinnate leaves close when touched by
children (or adults). Do not overwater, and water
from below. Very tough but you must be careful not
to “tickle-to-death.” Lilac-pink spherical flowers
precede the production of seedpods. Excellent for
container growing and greenhouse sales. Tender

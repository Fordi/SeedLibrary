John Bidwell (1819-1900), a Civil War General and
U.S. Senator who procured his stock seed from the
USDA in 1869. Amy Goldman, author of Melons for
the Passionate Grower, says the flesh “tastes like
heavenly orange sherbet.” An enormous melon—14"
long by 9" wide and weighing 16 pounds. So big you

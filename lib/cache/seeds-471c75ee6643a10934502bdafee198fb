brought to SSE by Ben Gabel and Kate McEvoy.
Robert’s grandmother got the seed “from the head
gardener at a big country house during the war” and
grew it in her garden in the village of Pickworth,
Lincolnshire, England. A traditional tall pea that
reaches heights of 10 feet—a great return for a small
space. Eight to ten peas per pod. Shell, 60-75 days.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:10:"directSeed";s:10:"2-3" Apart";s:9:"seedDepth";s:6:"1/2-1"";s:9:"rowsApart";s:3:"24"";s:7:"support";s:7:"Trellis";}}

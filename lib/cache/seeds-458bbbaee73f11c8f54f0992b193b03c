    Unique taste and smooth texture
make this variety a favorite for
many. Slightly sweet flavor gets sweeter
with longer storage. Snow white flesh is
perfect for mashing, but is also excellent
for any preparation. Beautiful purple skin
with red-pink marbling. Average tubers
are 3Â½-4" in diameter, with potential
for larger tubers. Excellent storage
qualities. 80-100 days.SOLD OUT";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":0:{}}

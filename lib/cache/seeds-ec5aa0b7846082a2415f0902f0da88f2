Paris still exist by their true names. Fortunately for
gardeners, seedsman Kees Sahin kept a collection
of 13,000 violas in the Netherlands. Through his
incredible knowledge of historic varieties, Kees reassembled
a mixture closely resembling the original
“Bambini Mixture” from Vilmorin. The flowers are
reminiscent of little smiling faces with distinct
whiskers. Self-seeding biennial, 6-8" tall.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:12:"startIndoors";s:27:"6-8 weeks before last frost";s:11:"germination";s:10:"10-14 Days";s:13:"plantOutdoors";s:10:"6-9" Apart";s:5:"light";s:17:"Sun/Partial Shade";}}

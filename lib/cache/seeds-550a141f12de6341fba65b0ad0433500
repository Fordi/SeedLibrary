Budapest around 1900. Jerry Muller of Alabama
(formerly of Tennessee) was the first SSE member to
offer this variety; in 1988 he listed his seed source as
Ed Simon of Pennsylvania. Huge pink oxheart fruits
weigh upwards of one pound. Very few seeds and
almost no cracking. One of our favorites for fresh
eating, canning, and for making roasted tomato
sauce. Indeterminate, 85 days from transplant.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:12:"startIndoors";s:25:"6 weeks before last frost";s:11:"germination";s:9:"7-14 Days";s:13:"plantOutdoors";s:12:"24-36" Apart";s:7:"support";s:22:"Cage, stake or trellis";}}

¾" metallic purple-black berries in clusters. Best
when picked after berries turn from glossy to dull
black. Tasteless when raw and unsweetened, but
can be made into delicious mock blueberry pies and
preserves. Use about 1 pound of berries to ½ cup of
sugar for best flavor. Good for freezing and canning.

V. Burrell. Large fruits are well suited for home and market gardeners.  Netted melons weigh up to 5 pounds and have extremely thick, sweet, flavorful, salmon-colored flesh. A great standard variety for home or market gardeners.  82 days.

Average Seeds per Ounce = 1,100

Planting: Best when direct seeded in warm soil after the danger of frost has passed. Plant 6-8 seeds 1" deep in 12" diameter hills spaced 6' apart each way. After germination pinch off all but 3-4 of the strongest seedlings. 

Saving Seed: Melons will cross-pollinate, so isolate ¼ mile from other "melons" (cantaloupes, muskmelons, honeydew, snake melon and Armenian cucumbers will all cross). Always save seeds from disease-free, early ripening melons. Wash seeds from ripe melons in a strainer and dry. Seeds are ready to store when they break instead of bend.";s:10:"Attributes";O:8:"stdClass":0:{}}

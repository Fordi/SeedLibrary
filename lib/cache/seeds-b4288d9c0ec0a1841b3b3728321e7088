Cook in the 1770s. Not a true spinach, but similar
in flavor and usage. Strong spreading plants branch
freely. Fleshy leaves are great for fresh summer
greens. Thrives in hot weather, resists bolting. Best
when picked all summer and fall. Seeds are slow to
germinate, so be patient. Good source of vitamin C.
